## Decentralized voting on Ethereum

### Why decentralized voting?

People should have control over their vote and have faith in any given election. This expectation is at the heart of democracy, one person one vote, and our most advanced technologies should empower us to conduct free and fair elections.

A public blockchain, uncensored and uncontrolled by a central authority, is such a technology. Smart contracts, programs that perform operations in the blockchain, can easily tally votes in a secure and durable manner.

Our platform, decentralvote, uses these technologies to deliver a comprehensive, modern alternative to traditional voting worldwide that is transparent, trustworthy, and inclusive.
