# Contributing to this white paper

Thank you for your interest and contributions to the decentralvote white paper.

This document aims to clearly express the opportunity we have to reimagine voting for all people and organizations using the Ethereum blockchain.

Everyone is welcome to participate and encouraged to help make this a reality.

## How do I contribute?

_Please open an issue._ Issues will help focus discussion around any given topic that we can link back to proposed changes. Deliberation is not as straightforward within pull requests.

From that issue, we can work together to determine the next steps.

## What should be in a contribution?

There are no rules for contributions. Improvements for spelling, grammar, vocabulary, citations, formatting, and more are welcome and encouraged.
